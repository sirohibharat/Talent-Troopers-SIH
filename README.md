## ðŸ¤” Problem Statement (SIH25033)

The current process for allocating internships under the PM Internship Scheme is largely manual, time-consuming, and prone to potential biases. Recruiters spend a significant amount of time screening thousands of resumes, making it difficult to ensure that every candidate is evaluated fairly and that the best-fit interns are matched to the right opportunities. This creates administrative overhead and can lead to less-than-optimal placements.

## âœ¨ Our Solution

Our project, the **AI-Based Smart Allocation Engine**, is a software solution under the **Smart Automation** theme that revolutionizes the internship allocation process. Instead of relying on simple keyword matching, our AI understands the context, skills, and experience within a resume, much like a human recruiter would. [cite: 20]

The system automates the initial screening, generating a ranked list of top candidates for each role, which makes the hiring process over **70% faster**. It ensures that the final selections are fair, transparent, and meet diversity requirements. A dedicated portal provides recruiters with intelligent suggestions, while always keeping them in control of the final decision.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

* [cite_start]**Intelligent Resume Parsing:** AI reads and understands resumes for skills and experience, not just keywords. [cite: 20]
* [cite_start]**Automated Shortlisting:** Automatically generates a ranked list of the most promising candidates for each role. [cite: 21]
* [cite_start]**Fairness & Transparency:** The system is designed to ensure that final choices are fair and meet diversity requirements. [cite: 23, 24]
* [cite_start]**Recruiter-in-the-Loop:** A dedicated portal provides smart suggestions, but recruiters always have the final say and can override AI recommendations. [cite: 25, 26]
* [cite_start]**Feedback Loop:** The system continuously learns and improves from recruiter feedback and real-world outcomes. [cite: 60, 83]

## ðŸ”§ Technical Approach

Our system follows a structured pipeline to ensure optimal and fair candidate allocation:

1.  [cite_start]**Input Preparation:** Resumes are uploaded, parsed, and relevant data is extracted. [cite: 43, 45, 48]
2.  [cite_start]**Scoring and Embedding:** The extracted data is converted into embeddings, and each candidate is assigned a score. [cite: 46, 49, 29]
3.  [cite_start]**Allocation and Output:** Business rules and fairness constraints are applied to generate a shortlist. [cite: 58, 55] [cite_start]This list is then reviewed by a recruiter, whose feedback can be used to re-score or reallocate, ultimately leading to the selection of the best candidates. [cite: 56, 60, 65]
