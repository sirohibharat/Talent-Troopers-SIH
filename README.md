## ðŸ¤” Problem Statement (SIH25033)

The current process for allocating internships under the PM Internship Scheme is largely manual, time-consuming, and prone to potential biases. Recruiters spend a significant amount of time screening thousands of resumes, making it difficult to ensure that every candidate is evaluated fairly and that the best-fit interns are matched to the right opportunities. This creates administrative overhead and can lead to less-than-optimal placements.

## âœ¨ Our Solution

Our project, the **AI-Based Smart Allocation Engine**, is a software solution under the **Smart Automation** theme that revolutionizes the internship allocation process. Instead of relying on simple keyword matching, our AI understands the context, skills, and experience within a resume, much like a human recruiter would. [cite: 20]

The system automates the initial screening, generating a ranked list of top candidates for each role, which makes the hiring process over **70% faster**. It ensures that the final selections are fair, transparent, and meet diversity requirements. A dedicated portal provides recruiters with intelligent suggestions, while always keeping them in control of the final decision.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Approach

Our system follows a structured pipeline to ensure optimal and fair candidate allocation:

1.  **Input Preparation:** Resumes are uploaded, parsed, and relevant data is extracted. 
2.  **Scoring and Embedding:** The extracted data is converted into embeddings, and each candidate is assigned a score. 
3.  **Allocation and Output:** Business rules and fairness constraints are applied to generate a shortlist. This list is then reviewed by a recruiter, whose feedback can be used to re-score or reallocate, ultimately leading to the selection of the best candidates.
